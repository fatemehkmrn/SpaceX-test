### `Description`
In this sample project, the SpaceX upcoming and former launches are listed, each summerising some short information about the name, location, date and success of mission. filtering the listo based on lauch site names is available. Redux-saga is used to create the store, and I tried to handle possible asynchronous side-effect, also I avoided using any extra UI components.
